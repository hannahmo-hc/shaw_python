This is a mistakes log, starting with exercise 7. In previous exercises, I forgot periods or missed quotation marks.

*Discoveries*
- TRUE and T behave differently than True 
- `pydoc [function]` tells you about that (python) function
- `man [function]` also tells you about that (cli) function 


*Mistakes*
- Missed punctuation outside of f"statement {like this}."
- Ran script without arguments
