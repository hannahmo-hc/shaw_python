This is a mistakes log, starting with exercise 7. In previous exercises, I forgot periods or missed quotation marks.

*Discoveries*
Not a mistake so much as a discovery -- TRUE and T behave differently than True 
another discovery -- `pydoc [function]` tells you about that function


*Mistakes*
- Missed punctuation outside of f"statement {like this}."
- Ran script without arguments
